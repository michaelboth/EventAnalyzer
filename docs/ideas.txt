API:
 - Allow folders to also contain instance, locations, and value? Can this meaningfully help with anything?
 - When flushing, identify the difference between header and data, to allow output stream to skip multiple headers that are always identical


Visualizer:
 - Filter dialog:
   - Collapse filtered rows to a few pixels to make it obvious filtering is active
 - From the time align dialog:
       - Allow clock drift correction between files via scaling first and last event instances
 - Search for largest duration/gap (similar to prev/next event)
