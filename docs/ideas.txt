API:
 - Allow folders to also contain instance, locations, and value?
 - When flushing, identify the difference between header and data, to allow output stream to skip multiple headers that are always identical


Visualizer:
 - Filter dialog:
   - Collapse filtered rows to a few pixels to make it obvious filtering is active
 - Mouse mode: adjust event times (equally for all events in a file)
   - Grab row and move left/right to align events file
   - Via dialog?
     - Shift rows to start time of 0
     - Shift rows to native start
     - Align by event instances (ignore folders and threads?)
       - Draw lines between alignments
       - Allow clock drift correction between files via scaling first and last event instances
 - Events buttons:
   - Search for largest duration/gap (similar to prev/next event)?
