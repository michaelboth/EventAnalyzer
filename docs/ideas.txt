API:
 - When flushing, identify the difference between header and data, to allow output stream to skip multiple headers that are always identical
 - ??? Add new API to fill in external clock time... e.g. may be helpful with CUDA event times
 - ??? Is there an elegant way to merge the event IDs enumeraton with the registration list and folder list

Visualizer:
 - Allow the files to also be sorted by time & event ID, not just alphabetical?
 - From the time align dialog:
    - Allow clock drift correction between files via scaling first and last event instances
