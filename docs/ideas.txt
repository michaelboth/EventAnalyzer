Tutorial/Demo:
  - Slide deck plus examples to show off general usage
  - Compare vector multiply via IPP, CUDA, and OpenCL?

API:
 - When flushing, identify the difference between header and data, to allow output stream to skip multiple headers that are always identical
 - Add two fields to UkEventInfo:
    - const char *start_value_name;
    - const char *end_value_name;

Visualizer:
 - A names to each group in bottom tool bar
 - A vertical names to each group in left tool bar
 - Mouse info rollover
   - Center title name (and remove event icon)
   - Put event or gap icon above durations
   - Avoid colored text
   - Use whiter background to bring out dark text
   - Use independnt lines for
      - <N> Idle Gaps: ave time <time>
      - <N> Durations: ave time <time>
 - Add optional gridlines (via toggle button)
 - Time bar should be from zero. Then no need for "+" on remaining deltas.
 - Show selected duration somewhere else
 - Show visible duration somewhere
 - If no file loaded, show visible hints?

 - Remember the window size from run to run
 - Allow the files to also be sorted by time & event ID, not just alphabetical
 - From the time align dialog:
       - Allow clock drift correction between files via scaling first and last event instances
 - Search for largest duration/gap (similar to prev/next event). Maybe allow dialog to select Nth largest gap
