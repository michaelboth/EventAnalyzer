API:
 - When flushing, identify the difference between header and data, to allow output stream to skip multiple headers that are always identical
 - ??? Add new API to fill in external clock time... e.g. may be helpful with CUDA event times
 - ??? Is there an elegant way to merge the event IDs enumeraton with the registration list and folder list

Examples:
 + Minimize macros, and rename to match unikorn functions

Presentation:
 - Ultimate flexibility
   - App defines clock
   - App defines method to flush results; e.g. file, socket, etc.
   - App defines event properties (name, color, and names of attached values)
   - App defines if event session is thread-safe or not
   - App defines if extra info is recorded: instance, app defined value, location in source file

Visualizer:
 + Add 3rd digit for version number
 + Copyright 2021-2023
 + Fix name: ave to avg
 + Update tool tip for histogram to say "in the current view"
 + Change the 'find max duration button' to do the following
    - Toggle to highlight max duration in each row of current view
    - If row is selected, then only show for highlighte row?
    - Use black/white circle for indicator
 + Add button similar to highlight max duration, but for min duration
    - Use black/white diamond for indicator
 - Allow the files to also be sorted by time & event ID, not just alphabetical?
 - From the time align dialog:
    - Allow clock drift correction between files via scaling first and last event instances
